# Conventions:
#  - Always pin requirements exactly (using ==). This prevents unexpected upgrades breaking the code
#  - Always include dependencies of packages. We install with --no-deps to prevent version clashes between dependencies
#  - Put an empty line and comment line above each requirement, with the dependencies directly underneath

Django==2.2.3
